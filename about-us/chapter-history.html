<h1>chapter history</h1>
<p>
The Zeta Omicron chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was established on May 24, 2011 at the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. The founding group of 31 students and 7 advisors were under the guidance of the chapter’s first president: Robert Kimball. Zeta Omicron maintained its success until the 1980's; it was then that the chapter was declared inactive.
<br><br>
In the spring of 1992, the re-chartering effort was initiated by a Cal Poly student that was formerly associated with Eagle Scouts. His ambition helped to motivate a group of 23 people (including former San Luis Obispo Councilman Paul Brown) in joining his effort of reinitiating the service-based fraternity. The founding brothers of the re-chartering group were all active participants in other Greek organizations on campus; some members were even a part of the Order of Omega – an honor society that recognized active Greek members for their notable contributions to their respective organizations.
<br><br>
On June 6, 1992, the Gamma Beta chapter conducted the initiation ritual and the Zeta Omicron chapter was officially rechartered with 24 new members and 4 advisors. Under the presidency of William Overland, the Zeta Omicron chapter welcomed 50 new pledges in the fall of 1992. With over 70 members, Zeta Omicron began their mission in serving the community with their first service project: a beach clean-up along the northern San Luis Obispo County coast.
<br><br>
On January 14th, 2012, the brothers of the Zeta Omicron chapter conducted the initiation ritual for University of California Santa Barbara's Psi chapter during the Region X Conference and re-chartered with 23 new members.
